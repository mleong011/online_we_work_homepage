# Online_we_work -> Study Buddies
## Inspiration
In a time where people are instructed to social distance due to covid-19 it has been very difficult for people to come together in social places. This app is inspired by WeWork that provides shared workspaces for people to come together to work together or separately in a social setting. Study Buddies provides a virtual version where people can come together in chat rooms to work either together or online while having other like minded people around to bounce ideas off of or ask questions.
Chat rooms are created based on different topics and categories.
* This was created as part of the ctp homehacks hackathon
* Other team members involved created the login page, chat room page, and backend databasing. (Xinyan Chen, Wengsing Wong, Yuanyuan Niu, Joshua Carpentier)
* My contribution can be found in this github repo and consists of the homepage for the app.

# online_we_work_homepage
* This project is the homepage for our online wework phone application.
* This code was created and run using Flutter on Android Studio.


## Requirements

## Notes
This was my first time working with Android Studio and Dart. 
It was overwhelming at first, but I was able to learn a lot about the Dart language and its similarities to Java. 
Learned how to use widgets and provide some degree of functionality.
Towards the end I was able to send up a clickable to lead to another dart file, which was very exciting!
